Meet Elena, creator and Co-captain of Krewe du Moon. She dances as Sailor Venus, is Sailor Moon’s understudy, & cosplays as Neo Queen Serenity along side her daughter ChibiChibi Moon. Her signature throws are Sailor Moon Pies, “Get Mooned” Undies & Bandoliers. When she’s not masquerading as a Guardian of Love & Justice, you can find her advocating for elders living with Dementia or nerding out with family and friends.
