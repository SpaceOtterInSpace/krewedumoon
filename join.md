Krewe Du Moon is actively recruiting this year. We are interested in Sailor Scout dancers and guardian helpers for parades and various events throughout the year.

During parade season we gather once a week to practice our dances and work on our throws.

To join Krewe Du Moon, email our fearless leader Usagi at krewedumoon@gmail.com and tell us why you want to be apart of our group and whether you're interested in dancing or supporting during parades.

Krewe Du Moon accepts all who are interested in Sailor Moon and kick ass costumes.
